# OpenGL
Learning and implementing OpenGL stuff

Mostly following Cherno series on youtube, about OpenGL.
Now it has become kinda a 2D API/ CAD for drawing points, lines and polygons.

## DONE:
> OpenGL Abstraction:
    > Vertex Array Objects
    > Vertex Buffer
    > Index Buffer
    > Layouts
    > Shaders
> Scenes
> Geometry:
    > Points
    > Lines
    > Polygons

## TODO:

> Fix Colors:
    > Lines and Polygons should have the option for it's own color
> Finish Line and Polygon Modes
> Separate into different Projects (maybe create another repo called: "2D graphics api"):
    > 2D Graphics API (core): OpenGL stuff and Scenes
    > Geometry API
