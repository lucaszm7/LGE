# OpenGL
Learning and implementing OpenGL stuff

Mostly following Cherno series on youtube, about OpenGL.
Hope in the future build kinda of a render API/ Game Engine, or something like that.

Now it has become kinda a 2D API/ CAD for drawing points, lines and polygons.

# TODO:
> Put Geometry in same header
> Finish Polygon Struct
> Finish Line Modes
